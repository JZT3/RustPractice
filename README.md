# RustPractice

In lieu of the White House announcement of **TRACTOR**(https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/translating-all-c-to-rust), I am future-proofing my skills. I am focusing on low-level applications, and this repository exists to host my fundamentals as I learn Rust and explore its nuances.

## Repository Purpose

This repository is dedicated to:

- Documenting my learning process as I explore Rust's syntax, semantics, and best practices.

- Hosting code snippets, exercises, and projects that illustrate fundamental concepts and advanced features of Rust.

- Serving as a personal reference and potentially aiding others who are also movign from C/C++ into Rust programming.
